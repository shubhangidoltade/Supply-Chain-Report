# Supply Chain System Dashboard

This project involved the creation of a Power BI dashboard to analyze and optimize various aspects of the supply chain, including product sales, supplier performance, shipping metrics, and cost optimization. The insights derived from this analysis aim to improve decision-making, efficiency, and profitability across the supply chain.

## Overview

The analysis includes a range of KPIs and metrics, providing deep insights into areas like total revenue, product sales, inventory management, supplier performance, and defect rates. Key areas explored include:

- **Total revenue, total products sold, and total cost**.
- **Profitability analysis** through average profit margins.
- **Stock levels and inventory management** by SKU.
- **Shipping and transportation performance**.
- **Supplier performance analysis**, including costs, stock levels, and defect rates.
- **Defect rate analysis** and identification of potential improvements.

## Key Features

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Total Revenue**: Overall revenue generated from sales.
- **Total Products Sold**: The total number of products sold across the supply chain.
- **Total Cost**: The overall cost of products, including manufacturing, shipping, and overhead.
- **Average Profit Margin**: Average profit margin calculated across product types and SKUs.
- **Stock Level**: A measure of current inventory across different SKUs.

### Revenue Analysis by Demographics

- **Total Revenue by Customer Demographics**: Analysis of revenue generated by different customer segments, helping to identify the most profitable customer categories.

### Defect Rate Analysis

- **Average Defect Rate by Product Type**: Analyzing defect rates by product type to identify areas where quality can be improved and costs reduced.
- **Average Defect Rate by Transportation Mode**: Assessing the impact of different transportation modes on product defects, aiming for more efficient logistics.

### Product and SKU Analysis

- **Total Revenue by Product Type**: Revenue breakdown by product category to understand which product types contribute most to overall sales.
- **Total Revenue by SKUs**: Analyzing revenue performance at the SKU level.
- **Price and Total Products Sold by SKU and Product Type**: Examining the price and sales volume for each SKU and product type to optimize pricing and inventory.

### Supplier Performance Metrics

- **Supplier Name vs. Average Profit Margin**: Comparing suppliers' average profit margins to assess which suppliers contribute more profit.
- **Supplier Analysis by Cost**: A breakdown of the supplier's costs, including manufacturing, shipping, and other overheads.
- **Profit Margin and Defect Rate by Supplier Name**: Evaluating both defect rates and profit margins to identify suppliers that need improvement.

### Inventory and Shipping Metrics

- **Stock Level by SKU**: Tracking the stock levels for each SKU to ensure efficient inventory management.
- **Lead Time by SKU**: Monitoring the time it takes for products to reach the warehouse for each SKU.
- **Total Cost by Transportation Mode**: Evaluating the transportation costs associated with different shipping modes.
  
### Order Quantities and Stock Management

- **Order Quantities vs. SKU**: Analyzing order quantities to identify discrepancies or inefficiencies in demand planning.
  
### Supplier Stock Levels

- **Supplier Name by Stock Level**: Comparing stock levels by supplier to ensure optimal supply chain balance.
  
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Total Revenue**: The total revenue generated across the entire supply chain.
- **Total Products Sold**: The total number of products sold within the analysis period.
- **Average Profit Margin**: The average profit margin across different product types and SKUs.
- **Stock Levels**: Monitoring the inventory levels of products across the supply chain.
- **Defect Rate**: Analyzing the rate of defective products per product type and shipping mode.
